        <!-- We add the custom control style we created to generic.xaml which is a special xaml file used by WPF style lookup.  This makes it so that it can be discovered at run time and applied implicitly to all KeySwitchControlTypes.
        An alternative would be to explicitly reference our style by name when we created the control in the view model-->
